WHAT IS FINA?
=============

FINA (FINA Is Not ANS) is a small direct-threaded Forth
compiler/interpreter. Should be easy to port and embed in other
applications. Tries to follow the ANS Forth standard. Currently
supports PowerPC and X86 (MIPS and ARM untested).


ROOTS
=====

FINA is inspired by hForth ( http://www.taygeta.com/hforth.html )
and Gforth ( http://www.gnu.org/software/gforth/ ). 


BUILD REQUIREMENTS
==================

- GCC ( http://gcc.gnu.org ). Versions 2.x and 4.x seem to generate
  better code than 3.x. In some cases, 3.x might even generate wrong
  code.

- libffi ( http://sources.redhat.com/libffi/ ). Recent versions of
  libffi are distributed with gcc sources. If your package system
  doesn't offer a prepackaged libffi and you don't want to download
  the full GCC sources, you can get the tarball that comes with
  elastiC ( http://www.elasticworld.org/download_devel.html )

- SCons ( http://scons.org ). This one requires a Python installation.


BUILDING
========

Typing the following will build and install under a directory called "inst":

$ scons

To start the interpreter:

$ inst/bin/fina

You can get help with:

help <word>

To pass some regression tests, build with:

$ scons check=1

To perform some benchmarks, build with:

$ scons bench=1


INSTALLATION
============

To install, just build passing a prefix argument:

$ scons prefix=/tmp/fina


STATUS
======

You can get a report on implemented/missing words running:

$ inst/bin/fina test/checkans.fs


THANKS
======

Thanks to the authors of hForth and Gforth for building those great
pieces of software.
