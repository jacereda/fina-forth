Yes, this README sucks, but you know, it is still unreleased.

To build the software, install scons ( http://scons.org ) and
libffi. Then run:

$ scons

To start the interpreter:

$ bin/fina

You can get help with:

help <word>

To pass some regression tests, build with:

$ scons check=1

To perform some benchmarks, build with:

$ scons bench=1

To install, just build passing a prefix argument:

$ scons prefix=/tmp/fina/

(The ending slash is required!)
