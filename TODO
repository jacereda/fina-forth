- Fix -1 0 ?do i . loop (should work as in gforth)
- Blocks
- Make it possible to compile without bootstrap compiler (keep .s files for
  the supported architectures). Should also drop the gcc2 build-depend.
- isolate compiler constants (/dict et al) from arch-specific code
- negative strings?
- douser is slow
- implement USEPFR for better code on MIPS machines.
- cleanup host-gforth
- fast dictionary search using endian-specific code, i.e
   if (((*(CELL*)cstr1) << 3) == ((*(CELL*)cstr2) << 3)) ...
- factorize INTERPRET with something like FOREACHPARSED
- implement defer..is and remove @execute
- EVALUATE should use SAVE-INPUT
- document
- split ?dodefine -> ?xt+xtbody
- documentation system
- more file tests
- forlist/repeat?
- implement user and remove fake definition from host-fina.fs
- remove debug stuff (shifts, type2, rdepth, rpick...)
- split docreate -> dovar+dodoes
- cross-compiling support
- ensure headers compiled with s, don't yield different images in test
- 0 -1 1 perform 0<> >= u> u>= <> lshift arshift fm/mod / mod /mod as primitives
- implement as primitives >= u> u>= <> dofor do?do lshift rshift /mod /
